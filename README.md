# react-native-swipe-list-view

**ðŸ’¥ðŸ”¥Breaking Changes in v1.0.0:ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¥**

`SwipeListView` now supports `FlatList`! (and `SectionList`)

Please see the section [Migrating To FlatList](https://github.com/jemise111/react-native-swipe-list-view#migrating-to-flatlist) for all details.

Migrating to `SectionList` is very similar. Please see `example.js` for a full usage example.

You can continue to use the (deprecated) `ListView` component, however there are some BREAKING CHANGES that are explained in that section as well

--------

```<SwipeListView>``` is a ListView with rows that swipe open and closed. Handles default native behavior such as closing rows when ListView is scrolled or when other rows are opened.

Also includes ```<SwipeRow>``` if you want to use a swipeable row outside of the ```<SwipeListView>```

# Installation
```bash
npm install --save react-native-swipe-list-view
```

## Running the example

The application under ./SwipeListExample will produce the above example. To run execute the following:

* ```git clone https://github.com/jemise111/react-native-swipe-list-view.git```
* ```cd react-native-swipe-list-view```
* ```cd SwipeListExample```
* ```yarn```
* ```react-native run-ios | react-native run-android```

# Usage
```javascript
import { SwipeListView } from 'react-native-swipe-list-view';

render() {
    return (
        <SwipeListView
            useFlatList
            data={this.state.listViewData}
            renderItem={ (data, rowMap) => (
                <View style={styles.rowFront}>
                    <Text>I am {data.item} in a SwipeListView</Text>
                </View>
            )}
            renderHiddenItem={ (data, rowMap) => (
                <View style={styles.rowBack}>
                    <Text>Left</Text>
                    <Text>Right</Text>
                </View>
            )}
            leftOpenValue={75}
            rightOpenValue={-75}
        />
    )
}
```

*See ```example.js``` for full usage guide (including using ```<SwipeRow>``` by itself)*

#### Note:
If your row is touchable (TouchableOpacity, TouchableHighlight, etc.)  with an ```onPress``` function make sure ```renderItem``` returns the Touchable as the topmost element.

GOOD:
```javascript
renderItem={ data => (
    <TouchableHighlight onPress={this.doSomething.bind(this)}>
        <View>
            <Text>I am {data.item} in a SwipeListView</Text>
        </View>
    </TouchableHighlight>
)}
```
BAD:
```javascript
renderItem={ data => (
    <View>
        <TouchableHighlight onPress={this.doSomething.bind(this)}>
            <Text>I am {data.item} in a SwipeListView</Text>
        </TouchableHighlight>
    </View>
)}
```

#### Manually closing rows:

If your row or hidden row renders a touchable child and you'd like that touchable to close the row note that the ```renderItem``` and ```renderHiddenItem``` functions are passed ```rowData```, ```rowMap```. The ```rowMap``` is an object that looks like:
```javascript
{
    row_key_1: ref_to_row_1,
    row_key_2: ref_to_row_2
}
```

Where each ```row_key``` is the same key used by the `FlatList` taken either from the `key` property on your data objects or using the `keyExtractor` prop.

Each row's ref has a public method called ```closeRow``` that will swipe the row closed. So you can do something like:
```javascript
<SwipeListView
    renderHiddenItem={ (rowData, rowMap) => {
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={ _ => rowMap[rowData.item.key].closeRow() }>
            <Text>I close the row</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
    }}
/>
```

If you are using the standalone ```<SwipeRow>``` you can just keep a ref to the component and call ```closeRow()``` on that ref.

#### Per row behavior:

If you need rows to behave independently you can return a ```<SwipeRow>``` in the ```renderItem``` function. Make sure you import the ```<SwipeRow>``` in addition to the ```<SwipeListView>```. See the example below and the docs under [API](https://github.com/jemise111/react-native-swipe-list-view#API) for how to implement a custom ```<SwipeRow>```. There is also a full example in ```example.js```.

The following values can be dynamic by passing them as props on the ```<SwipeRow>```:
 * ```leftOpenValue```
 * ```rightOpenValue```
 * ```stopLeftSwipe```
 * ```stopRightSwipe```
 * ```closeOnRowPress```
 * ```disableLeftSwipe```
 * ```disableRightSwipe```
 * ```recalculateHiddenLayout```
 * ```directionalDistanceChangeThreshold```

```javascript
import { SwipeListView, SwipeRow } from 'react-native-swipe-list-view';

<SwipeListView
    dataSource={dataSource.cloneWithRows(data)}
    renderItem={ (rowData, rowMap) => (
        <SwipeRow
            disableRightSwipe={parseInt(rowId) % 2 !== 0}
            disableLeftSwipe={parseInt(rowId) % 2 === 0}
            leftOpenValue={20 + parseInt(rowId) * 5}
            rightOpenValue={-150}
        >
            <View style={styles.rowBack}>
                <Text>Left Hidden</Text>
                <Text>Right Hidden</Text>
            </View>
            <View style={styles.rowFront}>
                <Text>Row front | {data.item.key}</Text>
            </View>
        </SwipeRow>
    )}
/>
```

### Setting per row behavior using data

You can also customize your individual rows by passing in your row's `data` next props:
 * ```leftOpenValue```
 * ```rightOpenValue```
 * ```closeOnRowPress```
 * ```disableLeftSwipe```
 * ```disableRightSwipe```
 * ```stopLeftSwipe```
 * ```stopRightSwipe```

Example:
```javascript
const dataSource = [
    {
        name: 'Andy',
        age: 12,
        disableRightSwipe: true,
    },
    {
        name: 'Betty',
        age: 11,
        leftOpenValue: 150,
    },
    {
        name: 'Carl',
        age: 11,
    },
];
```

# Migrating To FlatList

In most ways migrating your `SwipeListView` is no different than migrating your typical RN `ListView` (`renderRow` -> `renderItem`, `renderHiddenRow` -> `renderHiddenItem`). The biggest difference is the identifier used to keep track of row ref's. Previously this was done using a unique hash for each row that looked like ``${secId}${rowId}``. Now, since FlatList requires the use of a unique `key` for each piece of data, the `SwipeListView` uses this unique key to keep track of row refs in place of the unique hash.

The biggest breaking change you will find is the signature of certain callback functions used to pass the `secId` and `rowId` as two separate arguments, whereas now they will pass one argument, the row's unique key.

e.g.

```javascript
onRowOpen(secId, rowId, rowMap) {
    // Grab reference to this row
    const rowRef = rowMap[`${secId}${rowId}`];

    // Do something with the row
    rowRef.closeRow();
}
```

would now look like:

```javascript
onRowOpen(rowKey, rowMap, toValue) {
    // Grab reference to this row
    const rowRef = rowMap[rowKey];

    // Do something with the row
    rowRef.closeRow();
}
```

The other breaking change introduced is how to do a slideout preview. If you'd like to do a slide out preview for one of the rows simply use the new prop `previewRowKey` and pass the key corrseponding with that row.


Here is a typical migration example:

BEFORE:

```javascript
<SwipeListView
    dataSource={this.ds.cloneWithRows(this.state.listViewData)}
    renderRow={ (data, secId, rowId, rowMap) => (
        <View>
            <Text>I am {data} in a SwipeListView</Text>
        </View>
    )}
    renderHiddenRow={ (data, secId, rowId, rowMap) => (
        <View style={styles.rowBack}>
            <TouchableOpacity onPress={ _ => rowMap[`${secId}${rowId}`].closeRow() }>
                <Text>Close</Text>
            </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
    )}
    leftOpenValue={75}
    rightOpenValue={-150}
    onRowOpen={(secId, rowId, rowMap) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            rowMap[`${secId}${rowId}`].closeRow()
        }, 2000)
    }}
    previewFirstRow={true}
/>
```

AFTER (Using FlatList):

```javascript
<SwipeListView
    useFlatList={true}
    data={this.state.flatListData}
    renderItem={ (rowData, rowMap) => (
        <View>
            <Text>I am {rowData.item.text} in a SwipeListView</Text>
        </View>
    )}
    renderHiddenItem={ (rowData, rowMap) => (
        <View style={styles.rowBack}>
            <TouchableOpacity onPress={ _ => rowMap[rowData.item.key].closeRow() }>
                <Text>Close</Text>
            </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
    )}
    leftOpenValue={75}
    rightOpenValue={-150}
    onRowOpen={(rowKey, rowMap) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            rowMap[rowKey].closeRow()
        }, 2000)
    }}
    previewRowKey={this.state.flatListData[0].key}
/>
```

This number is the stop value corresponding to the `rightOpenValue` (while the row is swiping in the left direction)

type: `number`


### `renderHiddenItem`

How to render a hidden row in a FlatList (renders behind the row). Should return a valid React Element.
This is required unless ```renderItem``` returns a ```<SwipeRow>``` (see [Per Row Behavior](https://github.com/jemise111/react-native-swipe-list-view#per-row-behavior)).

type: `func`

params: (rowData, rowMap)


### `renderItem`

type: `func`

params: (rowData, rowMap)


### `renderHiddenRow` [DEPRECATED]

How to render a hidden row (renders behind the row). Should return a valid React Element.
This is required unless ```renderRow``` returns a ```<SwipeRow>``` (see [Per Row Behavior](https://github.com/jemise111/react-native-swipe-list-view#per-row-behavior)).

type: `func`
